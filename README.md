## Obscura

**Obscura** is an experimental terminal UI system built around *emergent programming* rather than traditional widget or layout frameworks.

Instead of centralized rendering, Obscura treats the terminal as a living field where many small, local agents propose changes to individual cells. Simple settlement rules resolve conflicts, and coherent interfaces—menus, boxes, status lines, and interaction flows—*emerge* through iteration and constraint.

The project is intentionally minimal and TTY-first. It assumes a basic ANSI-style terminal, avoids heavyweight abstractions, and emphasizes:

* locality over global layout
* composition over inheritance
* constraints as a source of structure and beauty
* robustness through decentralization
* instrumentation and observation as first-class design tools

Obscura is designed as a laboratory as much as a toolkit: a place to explore how complex, legible, and expressive terminal interfaces can arise from small rules, limited resources, and deliberate constraints.

It favors durability, hackability, and long-term clarity over completeness or trend alignment.
